# The HTL Specification

The HTML Template Language (HTL), [formerly known as Sightly,](update.md) was introduced with Adobe Experience Manager 6.0 and takes the place of JSP (JavaServer Pages) as the preferred and recommended server-side template system for HTML.

The full HTL Specification, which defines the syntax and the behavior of the language, is detailed in its [Open Source Git repository](https://github.com/adobe/htl-spec)
