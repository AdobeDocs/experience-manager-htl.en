# The HTL Specification {#htl-specification}

The HTML Template Language (HTL), [formerly known as Sightly,](update.md) was introduced with Adobe Experience Manager 6.0 and is the preferred and recommended server-site template system for HTML, taking the place of JSP (JavaServer Pages). 

The full HTL specification, which defines the syntax and the behavior of the language, is detailed in its [Open Source Git repository](https://github.com/adobe/htl-spec)

If you are not familiar with HTL and its capabilities, please consider these resources:
