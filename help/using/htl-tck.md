# The HTL TCK{#the-htl-tck}

## HTML Template Language Technology Compatibility Kit

The HTML Template Language or HTL, formerly known as Sightly, was introduced with [Adobe Experience Manager](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management.html) 6.0 and takes the place of JSP (JavaServer Pages) as the preferred and recommended server-side template system for HTML.

This TCK provides a suite of tests meant to certify that an HTL implementation conforms with the official [language specification](https://github.com/adobe/htl-spec).

## More information

[Full information on HTL TCK is available in Github](https://github.com/adobe/htl-tck)
