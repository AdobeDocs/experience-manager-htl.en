# The HTL TCK {#the-htl-tck}

## What is HTL TCK

The [HTML Template Language](overview.md), formerly known as Sightly, was introduced with [Adobe Experience Manager](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management.html) 6.0 and takes the place of JSP (Java Server Pages) as the preferred and recommended server-side template system for HTML. 

The HTML Template Language Technology Compatibility Kit - HTL TCK - provides a suite of tests meant to certify that an HTL implementation conforms with the official [language specification](https://github.com/adobe/htl-spec).
